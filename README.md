Title: My Trip Tracker

Objective: I developed a mobile application as part of a school project using Android Studio. The aim was to create an app that assists users in planning, organizing, and overseeing their vacations and associated excursions. This application enables users to effortlessly create, modify, and remove vacation and excursion information, all of which is securely stored in a database for easy retrieval. The app offers various features, including the ability to set alerts for vacation start and end dates, as well as excursion details. Additionally, users can conveniently share their vacation and excursion details through email, clipboard, or SMS using the built-in sharing options. This application serves as a reliable tool for users to effectively manage their travel plans, track their activities, and stay updated on important dates and times.

Directions on how to operate the application and reach all the rubric aspects:

1. Download and install the Android application on an Android 8.0 or higher compatible device.

2. Refer to the provided storyboard with screenshots to visualize your journey and interactions within the application.

3. The main screen of the application is the home screen. From here, you can access the list of vacations by tapping the "View trips" button.

4. The "Vacations List" screen displays all the vacations you have added. To add a new vacation, tap the "+" button. This will take you to a screen where you can enter the vacation details, including title, hotel/accommodation, start and end date. Make sure all fields are filled correctly and the start date comes before the end date. If any information is missing or incorrect, a message will be displayed, preventing you from saving the data until it's accurate. Once you've entered all the details, tap the "Save" button. The new vacation will now appear in the list on the main screen.

5. To view the details of a vacation or make changes to it, tap on the vacation in the list. This will take you to the detailed vacation view, where you can see the title, hotel, start and end dates of the vacation. If there are any excursions associated with the vacation, they will be displayed on this screen as well.

6. To edit a vacation, tap on the vacation you want to modify from the list. You can make changes to the title, hotel, start and end dates by directly updating the respective fields. If you want to edit an excursion, tap on the excursion to modify its information. Once you've made the necessary changes, save the data by tapping the "Save" button.

7. In the detailed vacation view, you can expand the menu, which contains five actions you can perform on this screen: Add Excursion, Delete Vacation, Notify Start, Notify End, and Share.

8. To add an excursion, click on the "Add Excursion" option in the menu. This will take you to the excursion details screen, where you can enter the excursion title and date. Make sure the excursion date falls within the associated vacation. If you're adding a new vacation, save it first and then return to the vacation to add an associated excursion.

9. To delete the current vacation, select the "Delete Vacation" option. Note that you won't be able to delete a vacation with associated excursions until you delete all excursions associated with it first.

10. You can set an alert for the vacation start by choosing the "Notify Start" option from the menu. This will trigger a notification with the vacation title, indicating that the vacation is starting. Similarly, you can set an alert for the vacation end by selecting the "Notify End" option, which will trigger a notification indicating the end of the vacation.
